* I have submitted the first try of this project on 4 January 2022 and I received that the reviewer can't review this project because of **"Key parts of your submission were the same as another student's submission or an online source."** and reviewer sent me a GitHub link to that potential resource ,I frustrated because how could this be to work over 14 days in code to produce the same of someone's' code ,But when I read that referred project found that it is totally different from my code ,In addition there is many points I not familiar with in referred code ,But I would like to know how the reviewer saw this code identicality ,I need anyone tell me what is the similarity keys in both projects.
* Second issue: I need someone to tell me how can I prove that this is my own code without seeing any examples or solutions? ,Please I need to know the answer.
* If the reviewer familiar with the **Udacity course content** ,Will discover how I follow the instructor **(Daniel Silber backer)** ,Yes I follow every step has "Daniel" explained in the course ,If anyone take a look at "Daniel's" code will know that I follow his code sequences and steps.
* My another resources is a little examples for (async Await) in **MDN website** and that not solution it just description for the method or a function ,And some another description about (promises) in **w3schools** website ,I have no another resource and I repeat that is my own code with 14 days of work to produce it.
* Finally I submitted the project again with a README.md file to explain my code and steps in working on it and my references ,may that prove that this code is mine without any plagiarism.
